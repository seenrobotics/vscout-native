# vscout-native

The vscout suite is a group of scouting software for robotics competitions like VRC and FIRST. The original idea stemmed from the want/need for statistics, rankings and graphs at large events where many good teams are left unseen or misjudged. This is especially useful with a large amount of scouts in alliance situations. vscout-native provides a way of interacting with a database containing all the collected data using mobile devices.
